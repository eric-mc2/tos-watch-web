Ever wonder what is hiding in that terms of service update? Let's find out. 

This site was inspired by the incident when Zoom announced it would [use everyone's conversations as training data](https://therecord.media/zoom-ai-terms-of-service-update) and **no one noticed for six months**.


**Theory of Change:**

We all know that Terms of Service are broken and we all live with it. We don't have a lot of viable alternatives to the platforms we use. We've normalized the way our personal data is traded and sold.

But maybe the next ToS update is one step too far. Every update is a decision point. 

To suggest a service or document, email {{ personal.email }}.
