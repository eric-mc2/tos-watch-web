Ever wonder what is hiding in that terms of service update? Let's find out. 

This site was inspired by the incident when Zoom announced it would [use everyone's conversations as training data](https://therecord.media/zoom-ai-terms-of-service-update) and **no one noticed for six months**.


**Theory of Change:**

We all know that Terms of Service are broken and we all live with it. Broken meaning they are difficult to read and arguably do not provide informed consent. 

In a functioning market, firms should compete to make better commitments to privacy and community safety.

ToS Watch surfaces these commitments, helping consumers make informed choices where they entrust their data. Each ToS update is a potential decision point.
